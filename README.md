# Startup Diagnosis S2S Agent

An AI-powered voice agent backend designed specifically for conducting automated interviews with startup owners who are students at Link School of Business. This system provides intelligent conversation capabilities to gather insights about startup ventures, business models, challenges, and growth opportunities.

## Purpose

This voice agent serves as an automated interviewer that can:
- Conduct structured interviews with startup founders
- Gather comprehensive business insights and diagnostics
- Analyze startup challenges and opportunities
- Provide intelligent follow-up questions based on responses
- Generate valuable data for business education and mentorship

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Conversation Flow**: AI-driven interview process tailored for startup diagnosis
- **Voice AI Pipeline**: Built on [OpenAI](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/openai/), [Cartesia](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/cartesia/), and [Deepgram](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/deepgram/) for natural voice interactions
- **Contextual Understanding**: Advanced turn detection and speaker recognition for smooth conversations
- **Business-Focused Prompts**: Specialized prompts designed for startup evaluation and diagnosis
- **Real-time Processing**: Live conversation analysis and adaptive questioning
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed session recording and analytics for educational insights

This backend is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/) or [SIP-based telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/) for flexible deployment options.

## Dev Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```console
cd Startup-Diagnosis-S2S-Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required values:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`: Use [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) or [run your own](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/)
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ELEVEN_API_KEY`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk app env -w .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
python src/agent.py download-files
```

### Alternative Methods

To speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
python src/agent.py console
```

For the standard agent (may experience issues on Windows):

```console
python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
python src/agent.py start
```
